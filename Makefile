# This Makefile provides portable, stack-agnostic commands (unlike npm)

# These commands are meant to be run from your local machine, not from
# within the docker container. Each command handles exec'ing into the
# docker container to run the command

ifneq (,)
	This makefile requires GNU Make.

# Listing commands in the .PHONY section ensures that the command is recognized when
# running `make [command]`
#
# Otherwise, if a command is the same name as a folder/file in the root of the project,
# and the make command is run, `make` will attempt to `make` that file or folder.
